This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

## Where to find datasets:  The *datasets* library
```{r}
library(datasets)

seatbelts <- datasets::Seatbelts
print(class(seatbelts))

df <- as.data.frame(seatbelts)
print(head(df))
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.


## Load time-series modeling library (XTS and Zoo) and using them to decode the date column in the *datasets::Seatbelts* dataset
```{r}
library(zoo)
library(xts)
df$Date <- as.Date(time(seatbelts))
df$law <- as.factor(df$law)  # Convert the factor column into a categorical variable
print(sapply(df, class) )    # Print the class of each column in our dataset 

```
## Exploratory analysis of the difference between classes of law=1 and law=0 w.r.t DriversKilled and VanKilled. 
```{r}
boxplot(DriversKilled ~ law, data = df)
t.test(DriversKilled ~ law, data = df)  # Establish the "statistical significance" of the difference of means between law=1 and law=0 w.r.t DriversKilled

boxplot(VanKilled ~ law, data = df)
t.test(VanKilled ~ law, data = df)     # Establish the "statistical significance" of the difference of means between law=1 and law=0 w.r.t VanKilled

```

## Logistic regression for classification of whether the Law is effect for any given date 
```{r}
model <- glm (formula = law ~  DriversKilled + VanKilled, family = "binomial", data = df)
print(summary(model))

print(exp(model$coefficients))  # Printing the odds of the response of law=1 as evidenced by the coefficents of the logistic fit 

```

## Create predictions of the fit logistic model against our original data - each row being an independent evaluation of the model 
```{r}

predictionsOfLawInEffect <- predict(model, newdata = df)  # LOG ODDS of each row corresponding to when the law is in effect
boxplot(predictionsOfLawInEffect ~ df$law)  #Boxplot to find the optimal log-odds cutoff

# Categorize the predicted log odds based on a threshold obtained by inspection of the box plot above: 
predictionsOfLawInEffect_CATEGORICAL <- predictionsOfLawInEffect > -2

# Lets compare the actual v/s predicted state of law = 1 or 0 in a Confusion Matrix
print(table(df$law, predictionsOfLawInEffect_CATEGORICAL))  # Confusion matrix


```

## Visualize a probability density plot of the predicted odds of the response of law=1 in the predicted set of evaluated records

## ODDS = p / (1 - p); where ODDS = exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect)
## => (1 - p)*ODDS = p
## => p = ODDS/(1+ODDS)

```{r}
plot(density(exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect)))  # plot of the "ODDS" of each row being classified for the law being in effect

```

## Probability of each row  corresponding to the law being in effect: 
```{r}
plot(density(exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect)/(1+exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect))))  # plot of the "ODDS" of each row being classified for the law being in effect

print(summary(exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect)/(1+exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect))))

```

# Boxplot to find the optimal probability cutoff for dichotomization of the law=1 status
```{r}
boxplot(exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect)/(1+exp(predictionsOfLawInEffect)) ~ df$law)

```

# Perform Linear Regression as an example use-case to predicted drivers that died as a function of the law status of being in effect
```{r}

# Linear regression for REGRESSION of the number of people that died ON the X's 
# / regressors law-being-in-effect and total number of drivers  

# Y = number of people that died i.e.  DriversKilled variable
# X = [law, drivers, PetrolPrice]  # eliminate variables that are confounding the relationship between the predictor and the response of law=1 by logic

model2 <- lm (DriversKilled ~ law  , data = df)
print(summary(model2))

```


## Export df to a file:
```{r}
write.csv(df, row.names = F, file = "britishSeatBeltStudy.csv")
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
